# face-recognition-app-frontend

Frontend of the machine learning face recognition app made with React that you can see here: https://machine-learning-recognition.herokuapp.com/

You need to take the URL of a photo and the program will identify and indicate where the face is located.

Please take in consideration that the app may have some delays because I am using free Heroku version.

- I use BCRYPT for password security
- React for the frontend
- Nodejs/Express for the API
- Postgres for storing the users' information.
